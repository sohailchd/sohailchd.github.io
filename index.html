                - implemented Histogram Equalization using optimized GPU code in CUDA that provides the same functionality of the histogram equalization from OpenCV but can perform the algorithm faster
        
                </br>
                </br><strong>NGS sequencing of genomics data:</strong>
                </br>- Created a NGS genomics pipeline for sequencing of genomic data and annotation using BioPython. 
                </br>- Used bioinformatics tools for linux and python as scripting to create the pipeline and R markdown for reporting

                </br></br>
                <strong>Pneumonia Detection using radiograph images: </strong>
                </br>https://github.com/sohailchd/PneumoniaDetection
                </br>- Goal was to detect pneumonia infection in patients using convolutional neural network (CNN) of radiograph images and create a prediction model to correctly identify the infection in patients
                </br>- Achieved about 96% accuracy on augmented datasets of 20GB, used google colab and python for implementation, training and predictions
